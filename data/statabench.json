    "question":"3. Probability calculation for genetics (from Lindley, 1965): suppose that in each individual of a large population there is a pair of genes, each of which can be either x or X, that controls eye color: those with xx have blue eyes, while heterozygotes (those with Xx or xX) and those with XX have brown eyes. The proportion of blue-eyed individuals is $p^2$ and of heterozygotes is $2p(1-p)$, where $0 < p < 1$. Each parent transmits one of its own genes to the child; if a parent is a heterozygote, the probability that it transmits the gene of type X is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Assuming random mating, we know that among brown-eyed children of brown-eyed parents, the expected proportion of heterozygotes is $2p\/(1+2p)$. Suppose Judy, a brown-eyed child of brown-eyed parents, marries a heterozygote, and they have $n$ children, all brown-eyed. Find the posterior probability that Judy is a heterozygote and the probability that her first grandchild has blue eyes.",

    "ground truth2":"To automatically identify the most critical genetic markers associated with a specific medical outcome from a panel of 200 markers, we used Lasso regression (LassoCV) for feature selection. The model selected a subset of markers with non-zero coefficients, effectively ignoring irrelevant ones. Key results include a best alpha value of 2.655, an R² score of 0.980, and an RMSE of 1005.198. The non-zero coefficients indicate the most influential markers, such as feature_4 (63.626), feature_30 (79.322), and feature_58 (74.467), among others. This approach successfully isolates the strongest predictors while discarding redundant or unrelated features.",
